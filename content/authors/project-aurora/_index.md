A registered non-profit aimed at accelerating the creation, growth, and impact of youth-led mental health initiatives by providing mentorship, connections, administrative/logistical support, and funding.

We support teams of young adults/students working on community mental health projects. The chosen projects are those that directly impact communities in Vancouver facing mental health and well-being challenges.

Our complete website is currently in progress, but in the meantime, we are recruiting. If you are highly motivated, have a passion for mental health entrepreneurship, and have significant experience in marketing, finance, or sponsorship, we encourage you to apply [here](#careers)!
