The Project Aurora is a registered non-profit organization aimed at accelerating the creation, growth, and impact of youth-led mental health and well-being initiatives by providing mentorship, connections, administrative/logistical support, and funding. Support is provided to teams of young adults/students working on community mental health projects. Project Aurora strives to ensure that the projects chosen will directly benefit communities in Vancouver facing mental health and well-being challenges. 

The full website is set to be launched in a few months but in the meantime, we are currently recruiting for a few roles on the Project Aurora team itself. If you are a highly motivated individual with a passion for mental health innovation and significant experience in marketing, finance, or sponsorship, we encourage you to apply here!
