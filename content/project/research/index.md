A team working with UBC faculty on a study of campus mental health in the hopes of identifying gaps in the current system and encouraging the creation of new initiatives to bridge those gaps.

About the Mental Health Survey of UBC Students Study:

Project Aurora is  acutely aware of the fact that detailed data on student mental health is not readily accessible to the UBC community. The Project Aurora Mental Health Research Team works  to change that. This anonymous survey is an opportunity to gather essential descriptive data on student mental health status and experiences, likes and dislikes about support resources on campus, treatment preferences, and facilitators and barriers to help seeking behaviors. There are also several questions on wellbeing and demographics.

These survey results help  Project Aurora to better understand the mental health challenges that different UBC student populations face. 

Our aims are to: 
        Make a profile of student mental health publically accessible to the UBC community 
        Engage with on-campus support resources constructively 
        Offer evidence-based recommendations to improve existing on-campus resources
        Work to improve mental health resource accessibility for the various diverse student communities at UBC 

Details about the survey questionnaire:


This is an online survey conducted through the UBC Qualtrics platform and is  approximately 20 minutes long. Participants, after providing consent, will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding mental health and wellbeing. Upon survey completion, they will be redirected to a prize draw for a chance to win one of five $50 gift card prizes. The prize draw will require  contact information in order to contact prize draw winners. At the end of the study, 5 participants will be randomly drawn from the pool of contact information. There are five $50 gift card prizes, in the form of Amazon, Mastercard, or Visa gift cards. Each participant is only eligible to win one prize.
